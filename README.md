# 🎨 Grid Highlighter Assignment  

Hey Apoorva! 👋  

Your task is to build a fun and interactive grid where users can color the cells using different modes. Let’s break it down step by step!  

---

## ✨ What You'll Be Making  
A webpage with:  
✅ A **slider** to control the grid size  
✅ A **color picker** to choose a color  
✅ A **mode selector** to decide how the grid gets colored  
✅ A **clear button** to reset everything  

---

## 🔧 Features to Implement  

### 1️⃣ Grid Creation  
- Add a **slider** (`<input type="range">`) so users can set the grid size.  
- The grid should be **N x N** (where N is the slider value).  
- Use **CSS Grid (`display: grid;`)** to neatly arrange the cells.  

### 2️⃣ Color Selection  
- Add a **color picker** (`<input type="color">`) so users can choose any color.  

### 3️⃣ Coloring Modes  
Let users decide how they want to color the grid using a **dropdown (`<select>`)** with three options:  
🎨 **Mouseover** – Color the cell when hovering over it.  
🖱 **Click** – Color the cell only when clicked.  
✏ **Click & Drag** – Click once and drag to keep coloring until you release the mouse.  

### 4️⃣ Clear Grid  
- Add a **reset button** (`<button>`) to clear the grid and start fresh!

## 💡 Helpful Hints  
👉 Use **JavaScript event listeners** (`mouseover`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`) to handle interactions.  
👉 Use a **loop** to generate grid cells dynamically.  
👉 Add some **CSS transitions** to make color changes look smooth.

## 🎯 Bonus Challenge  
If you want to go the extra mile:  
✨ Make the UI look **really nice** with better styling.  
✨ Add a **hover effect** to show which cell is about to be colored.
